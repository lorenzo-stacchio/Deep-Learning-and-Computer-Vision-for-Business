        "In this tutorial, we will take a deeper look at how to fine-tune and perform feature extraction using `torchvision models <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html>`, all of which have been pretrained on the 1000-class ImageNet dataset. This tutorial will provide an in-depth understanding of how to work with several modern Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and develop intuition for fine-tuning any PyTorch model. Since each model architecture differs, there is no universal fine-tuning code that applies to all cases. Instead, researchers must inspect the architecture and make custom adjustments for each model.\n",

        "\n",
        "This function is designed to train a deep learning model using PyTorch. It handles the training and validation phases for multiple epochs and tracks the best-performing model based on validation accuracy. Below is an explanation of each part of the function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Function Arguments:**\n",
        "   - `model`: The model to be trained.\n",
        "   - `dataloaders`: A dictionary containing 'train' and 'val' dataloaders, which provide batches of data for training and validation.\n",
        "   - `criterion`: The loss function to be optimized.\n",
        "   - `optimizer`: The optimization algorithm used to update model weights (e.g., SGD, Adam).\n",
        "   - `num_epochs`: The number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset) to train the model (default: 25).\n",
        "   - `is_inception`: A flag indicating whether the model is Inception, as it has special handling due to auxiliary outputs during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initial Setup:**\n",
        "   - `since`: Records the starting time to measure how long training takes.\n",
        "   - `val_acc_history`: A list to store the validation accuracy at the end of each epoch.\n",
        "   - `best_model_wts`: Deep copy of the model's initial weights, used to save the best-performing model.\n",
        "   - `best_acc`: Keeps track of the highest validation accuracy achieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Training Loop:**\n",
        "   - The outer loop runs over a number of epochs.\n",
        "   - For each epoch, it prints the current epoch and separates the training and validation phases.\n",
        "   - For each phase ('train' or 'val'), it either sets the model to training mode (`model.train()`) or evaluation mode (`model.eval()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Batch Loop:**\n",
        "   - The inner loop iterates over batches of input data (`inputs`) and their corresponding labels (`labels`).\n",
        "   - The inputs and labels are moved to the device (e.g., GPU or CPU).\n",
        "   - The gradients of the model are reset using `optimizer.zero_grad()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Forward Pass:**\n",
        "   - In the forward pass, the model computes predictions on the inputs.\n",
        "   - For Inception models, the loss is calculated using both the primary output and the auxiliary output during training.\n",
        "   - The loss is computed using the provided loss function (`criterion`).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Backward Pass & Optimization:**\n",
        "   - For the 'train' phase, backpropagation is performed (`loss.backward()`) to compute gradients, and the optimizer updates the model's parameters (`optimizer.step()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Tracking Performance:**\n",
        "   - After processing each batch, the loss and number of correct predictions are accumulated to calculate the loss and accuracy for the entire epoch.\n",
        "   - The epoch's loss and accuracy are printed for both the training and validation phases.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Model Checkpointing:**\n",
        "   - If the validation accuracy for the current epoch exceeds the best accuracy observed so far, the model's weights are saved as the best model.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Completion:**\n",
        "   - After training completes, the total training time is printed.\n",
        "   - The function returns the model with the best validation accuracy and a history of validation accuracies.\n"
